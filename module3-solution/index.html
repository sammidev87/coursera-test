                The chicken is a bird that people all over the world raise for its 
                meat, eggs, and feathers. It belongs to the group of domesticated, 
                or tame, birds called poultry. Chickens have short wings and a heavy 
                body. This makes it hard for them to fly very far. Male chickens are 
                called roosters. Roosters often have brightly colored feathers. 
                They can be red, green, brown, black, or other colors. Female 
                chickens are called hens. Hens are usually brown or white. Both males 
                and females have one or two wattles. A wattle is skin that hangs from 
                the throat. Male and female chickens also have a comb, which is skin 
                that sticks up from the top of the head. Farmers usually keep 
                chickens inside large, modern buildings. They feed the birds corn 
                and other grains. Some farmers allow their chickens to roam free 
                outdoors. These chickens usually roost, or sleep, inside at night.
                Hens can lay more than 200 eggs a year. If a hen mates with a rooster 
                before laying eggs, the eggs will be fertilized. This means that they 
                will develop into chicks. But hens can lay eggs without mating. These 
                unfertilized eggs are the eggs that people eat. Wild birds called 
                jungle fowl are the ancestors of chickens. Jungle fowl belong to the 
                pheasant family. They live in parts of Asia, including India. Jungle 
                fowl eat seeds, fruit, and insects. They fly into trees to escape 
                from predators.
